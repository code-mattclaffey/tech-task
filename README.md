# Tech Challenge
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/code-mattclaffey/tech-task.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/code-mattclaffey/tech-task)


## What went well
- Screen reader functionality works like a treat!
- Managed to extract logic into components and write tests around specific things example SearchResultsComponent
- Styling was very straight forward
- CI integration with Netlify was very straight forward so I could deliver value constantly and the client (you) would see more features as the days went by.

## What didn't go well
- Mocking api calls
- Writing texts around the context components because of the api calls
- Type definitions in typescript are trickier to work with than interfaces so I had to add any all over the place.

## What could be better?
- Styling had more variables around spacing etc
- More knowlegde around api testing would of helped
- Use interface instead of types
- handle submission of the form on the server so when no javascript is happening due to a network outage etc then the form can still be submitted.
